\ourtitle{: Summary}

~

Preventable errors in healthcare are a leading cause of patient injury
and death~\citep{Kohn1999}.
%
Despite extensive effort and the expenditure of billions of dollars,
computerization has failed to solve this
problem~\citep{Landrigan2010}.
%
The PIs attribute this failure to a pervasive misunderstanding of the nature of
computation in healthcare.
%
While there has been a computer technology transfer in healthcare, we
await an intellectual transfer, in which software design,
maintainence, and debugging unlock the full potential of computer
science to improve healthcare.
%
The previous work of the PIs provides support for the claim that
\emph{a prescription is a program}, i.e., a medical algorithm.
%
This observation has the profound implication that knowledge
from computer science has direct application to the improvement of
healthcare performance.
%
This work has shown that software design and debugging of a
\emph{paper} prescription markedly decreases the rate of injury and
death associated with use of opioids in hospitalized patients
\citep{Belknap2008}.

There remains a knowledge gap: can we design a programming language
and adapt software engineering techniques to implement and maintain
highly reliable \emph{electronic} prescriptions?
%
To find out, the PIs will design and build the Patient-Oriented
Prescription Programming Language (\poppl{}) and evaluate if this new
platform can be used to improve management of the high blood sugar
levels that sometimes occur in pregnant women.
%
This condition is referred to as Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM).


The need for prevention and treatment of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus
(GDM) in the US is projected to double to 600,000 women over the next
3 years due to increasing maternal obesity and a lower diagnostic
threshold.
%
Limitations of current GDM management include low patient adherence,
modest efficacy of interventions, time-burden for clinicians, and
cost.
%
The PIs will use \poppl{} to create POP-GDM, an e-prescription to be
initiated early in the pregnancy of women at increased risk of GDM.
%
POP-GDM will help the PIs continually monitor patients and clinical
processes, identify omitted or delayed tasks and remediate them,
detect conditions requiring action, notify patients and clinicians,
and facilitate corrective action.

\noindent
\textbf{Intellectual Merit.}  
%
The PIs expect this work to generate multiple new insights regarding the
building and maintenance of multi-stage programs, the development of
new kinds of analyses of programs, and the discovery of new general
methods for developing high-reliability software that facilitates
collaboration between machines and humans.
%
Computer science has long been driven by application areas; from the
early days of missile-targeting systems, to the development of
scientific computation, to creation of data-security solutions, core
computer science discoveries have often been made because of a need to
solve a particular problem.
%
Given the power of the tools we will use and the cross-disciplinary
expertise and experience of the team we have assembled, the proposed
work is a tractable challenge that will produce important new insights
in computer science.
%
Suboptimal healthcare represents a major burden on patients, leading
to worse patient outcomes and/or higher cost. 
%
The work in this proposal will eventually lead to reduction in
preventable adverse events, therapeutic failure, medical error, and
waste. 
%
Such solutions are urgently needed if our society is to apply medical
knowledge to the advancement of the health of patients.

\noindent
\textbf{Broader Impacts.} The GDM \poppl{} program will lead
to powerful tools for management of GDM in general obstetric practice
in the US.
%
More broadly, \poppl{} will give clinicians a public-domain,
open-source framework for designing, creating, debugging, and managing
a broad array of prescriptions for other medical problems; give
researchers tools for acquiring data about the effect of healthcare
interventions; and eventually provide a simple, inexpensive means for
conducting cohort studies, statistical process control trials, and
randomized controlled trials.
%
The work proposed here and along the anticipated future research
trajectory will favorably impact all who interact with the healthcare
system: patients, clinicians, and researchers.

\section{Introduction}

According to a report published by the Institute of Medicine of the
National Academies~\citep{preventing-medical-errors}, patient errors
are prevalent and a cause of serious concern.
%
The report points out that while there is wide variation, ``on average
a hospital patient is subject to at least one medication error per
day.''
%
A study of data from 1993 estimated that inpatient errors cost \$5,857
per patient~\citep{bates-et-al-1997}, leading the National Academies
report to extrapolate to a nationwide cost of \$2.3 billion annually
(in 1993 dollars).

Others have noticed this problem and have responded by trying to
introduce computers to the process of prescribing medicine to
patients, using systems collectively dubbed Computerized Prescriber
Order Entry (CPOE).
%
When carefully implemented, CPOE has been shown to reduce the rate of
medication prescription errors but clinically-relevant benefits, such
as improving clinical outcomes or preventing patient deaths or
injuries have not yet been clearly demonstrated~\citep{vanRosse2009}.
%
Even in terms of error prevention, CPOE's introduction to the hospital
has been a mixed blessing.
%
Certain medical errors, such as those related to poor handwriting, are
reduced but other familiar errors continue to occur and some new types
of error are introduced by CPOE.
%
In one report, CPOE actually \emph{caused} 22 types of medication
error; problems included fragmented display of drugs, inventory
display mistaken for dose guidelines, duplicate and incompatible
orders, and inflexible formats~\citep{Koppel2005}.

Prescribers routinely compensate for CPOE's awkwardness by supplementing the prescription data they enter in structured fields with free-text instructions and additional verbal instructions to nurses and pharmacists. We were the first to point out that prescriptions are programs and thus require a richer syntax than is provided by existing CPOE software.
%
A large study found 1\% of prescriptions had free-text instructions
inconsistent with structured data fields and 20\% of these
inconsistencies risked moderate or severe patient
injury~\citep{Singh2009}.


Compared with previous paper prescriptions, CPOE impairs
synchronization and feedback mechanisms in nurse-physician
collaborations~\citep{Pirnejad2008}.
%
Clinicians have difficulty understanding CPOE prescriptions because
they are presented as decontextualized fragments.
%
Paper provides a richer medium for prescribing than does a CPOE data
table display.
%
Intriguingly, others have recently begun applying
requirements gathering, software specification, and other software
engineering techniques to the construction of order sets
\citep{health-requirements-engineering}.


We expect that computerization will eventually dramatically improve the quality of healthcare. We attribute the failure of current healthcare computerization efforts to achieve meaningful gains to fundamental flaws in the conceptual basis of existing CPOE software. 
%
Put positively, we believe that:
%
\begin{center}
\textbf{a prescription is a program}
\end{center}
%
That is, a prescription requires ``a series of definite steps that
carry out a procedure'' or, in other words, an \emph{algorithm}.
%
The research areas of programming languages and software engineering
have amassed substantial knowledge about how to accurately implement an
algorithm as a program, and for dealing with the issues of clearly expressing and maintaining those programs. This knowledge is directly relevant to healthcare prescriptions.
%
In short, computers are not the missing piece to fix the problems of
medicine delivery, the \emph{intellectual contribution of computer
  science itself} is the missing piece.

Our approach, dubbed Patient-Oriented Prescription (POP), explicitly
acknowledges the algorithmic nature of prescriptions, leveraging the
power of programming to help clinicians model, test, debug, and
iteratively refine their patient management plans.
%
POP implies both algorithmic representation of prescriptions
\emph{and} application of a broad swath of software engineering
techniques, including modeling, testing, debugging, and interactive
refinement.
%
These techniques apply regardless of whether the prescription is
ultimately performed by computers or by people.
%
Indeed, our past work with patient-oriented prescriptions has
relied heavily on human performance of prescriptions.
%
CPOE systems are disconnected from clinicians' task lists,  resource availability data, and sequence or resource dependencies. It is common practice that clinicians obtain information from hospital CPOE systems and use this information to construct a separate task list. Attempts to integrate tasks, resource availability, and dependencies into CPOE have largely failed because CPOE software was constructed without an understanding of the algorithmic nature of prescriptions and medical orders. Effectively, CPOE is little more than electronic paper.
%
The next logical step is to bring to bear all the intellectual capital
inherent in algorithmic representation of prescriptions.
%
The fruits of this proposal will provide a means by which computers
and devices actively support clinicians in their efforts to provide
patients with safe, effective healthcare.

The remainder of this proposal explains how we've established the
foundation for prescriptions as programs and for supporting
domain-specific languages, how this has led to interesting research
questions in computer science, and how we expect to carry out a
significant effort to validate our approach at Northwestern University
Hospital.

\section{Budget, Personnel, and a Cultural Chasm}

One difficulty we have struggled with in trying to find funding for
this project is the chasm that separates computer science and medical
culture.
%
In this proposal, this chasm is most evident in the budget. 
%
Our experience writing and reading SHF proposals has been that the
bulk of a conventional SHF budget goes to graduate student support,
followed by a month or so of salary for a PI, with travel,
equipment, and supplies making up a distant third.
%
This apportioning of funds fits will with the way most computer
science departments are organized, specifically with graduate students
that are in a position to make a strong contribution to the research
and faculty members who generally receive 9 months of salary
guaranteed by the university.
%
In contrast, even tenured biomedical faculty typically receive only
10\% of their salary guaranteed by the university.

Accordingly, our proposal includes four months of salary support for
Belknap, as compared with only one half of a month each for Findler
and Flatt.
%
Importantly, the difference in these numbers does not reflect a
difference in the level of commitment to the project from the PIs.
%
All three of us are equally and highly committed to improving the
state of the art in programming languages and software engineering by
bettering the practice of medicine and specifically prescriptions.


Simulation trials are expensive, and that expense is reflected in our
budget by the number of people involved.
%
Despite the expense, we believe that conducting a simulation is
critical to the success of \poppl{}.
%
That is, if we are to succeed in exploiting our motto that
prescriptions are programs, we must have the feedback from evaluating
or prescription programs in a true clinical setting.

The remainder of this section introduces the people we plan to be
involved in this project and what roles they play.

\begin{itemize}
\item\textbf{Robby Findler}; Findler is a Ph.D. in computer science;
  his dissertation improved the state of the art of software
  specifications, specifically how to state and enforce behavioral
  software contracts in a higher-order setting. He is one of the core
  members of the Racket development team and has helped to design and
  build many of the domain-specific languages discussed in
  section~\ref{sec:racket} of the proposal. Findler will be leading
  the development of the domain-specific language, focusing on the
  requirements gathering and language design issues, together with a
  PhD student.

\item\textbf{Steven Belknap}; Belknap is an M.D. specializing in
  Internal Medicine and Clinical Pharmacology. Belknap has extensive
  experience providing medical care hospitalized adults.  He also has
  training and experience as a computer programmer. His long–standing
  research interest has been ``algorithmic medicine''.  He is the
  first to have successfully applied software engineering and
  debugging methods to prescriptions for management of asthma,
  aminoglycoside antibiotic treatment of infections, anticoagulation
  therapy, and severe pain. Dr.\ Belknap was the principal
  investigator of a study involving more than 50,000 hospitalized
  adult patients treated with opioid analgesics as discussed in
  section~\ref{sec:pap}. Belknap introduced the main idea in this
  proposal, namely that ``A Prescription is a Program''. Belknap
  provides the overall vision and leads the clinical part of this
  project.

\item\textbf{Matthew Flatt}; Flatt is a Ph.D. in computer science; his
  dissertation improved the state of the art in modularity constructs
  for programming languages, specifically he designed, build, and
  proved properties of a new technique for mutually referential module
  systems. He is also one of the core members of the Racket
  development team and has helped to design an build many of the
  domain-specific languages discussed in section~\ref{sec:racket} of
  the proposal. Flatt will be leading the development of the runtime
  system to support \poppl{}, focusing on the back-end and
  infrastructure support at the Racket level. Flatt is the only team
  member not located in Chicago, but he and Findler have been
  collaborating over a long distance for a decade and he plans to make
  multiple trips to Chicago as part of this project.

\item\textbf{Dennis West}; West is a Professor of Dermatology and
  Pediatrics, a pharmacist, and Director of the Dermatopharmacology
  Program in the Department of Dermatology at Northwestern University,
  one of the largest such clinical research programs in the U.S. He is
  also Chair for Administrative Review with the Institutional Review
  Board for the Office for the Protection of Research Subjects at
  Northwestern University.  He served as Chair for the Dermatology
  Expert Panel at the United States Pharmacopeia from 2005--2010. West
  also leads RADAR (Research on Adverse Drug Events And Reporting), a
  proactive pharmacovigilance collaboration based at Northwestern, and
  has worked closely with Dr.\ Belknap for several years within RADAR
  and other pharmacovigilance projects. His role on this project will
  involve coordination with Walgreens and with the Pharmacy Department
  at Northwestern Memorial Hospital, and analysis and dissemination of
  results, with particular focus on the prescription design of the
  project.

\item\textbf{Boyd Metzger} Metzger is a physician specializing in
  Internal Medicine and Endocrinology. He has had a career-long
  interest in the perinatal and long-term consequences of GDM, the
  detection and diagnosis of GDM and its treatment. Metzger is a
  leading authority in the field of GDM. He led the seminal HAPO
  study~\citep{hapo}, which helped demonstrate the need for a lower
  threshold for intervention in GDM. He will provide domain expertise
  and advice in the area of GDM.

\item\textbf{Charlotte Niznik}; Niznik is an RN, Advance Practice
  Nurse and is the Maternal Fetal Medicine Specialist who coordinates
  the GDM program and the Maternal Obesity program at
  Northwestern. She has collaborated in preparation of this grant
  application and is a key source of insight and experience regarding
  the management of GDM.

\item\textbf{Alan Peaceman}; Peaceman is the Chief of the Division of
  Maternal/Fetal Medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School
  of Medicine.  He currently serves as Principal Investigator for the
  National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD)
  Maternal-Fetal Medicine Units Network Grant. Peaceman will
  collaborate on creation of POP–GDM and will provide domain expertise
  and clinical advice regarding management of GDM.

\item\textbf{Bonnie Spring}; Spring is a Ph.D. clinical health
  psychologist. Her research aims to understand the biobehavioral
  mechanisms that maintain unhealthy behaviors and to develop and test
  interventions that promote healthy behavior change. She has many
  years of NIH- and VA-funded clinical trials experience intervening
  to promote healthy behavior changes in diet, physical activity, and
  smoking, singly or conjointly. Spring sees the proposed research as
  an important next step in understanding how to optimize multiple
  risk behavior change.

\item\textbf{John Vozenilek}; Vozenilek is an Emergency Medicine
  Physician and is the Director of Simulation Technology and Immersive
  Learning for the Feinberg School of Medicine. In this capacity, he
  provides central coordination and oversight for undergraduate,
  graduate, interdisciplinary, and continuing medical education
  programs. For this project, Vozenilek will provide advice and
  direction regarding the performance of the prescription simulation
  portions of this proposed work. He will also participate in data
  analysis and preparation of manuscripts.

\item\textbf{Susan Eller}; Eller is a nurse and is the Director of
  Interprofessional Education at Northwestern University Feinberg
  School of Medicine. She will provide oversight and assistance
  regarding the performance of the prescription simulations.

\end{itemize}

\section{Curriculum Development Activities}

Findler and Flatt have a well-established track-record of
curriculum-related community outreach, stemming from the
\textit{TeachScheme!} project and it's successor, \textit{Program by
  Design}. Both of these are centered around the text book \textit{How
  to Design Programs}~\citep{fffk:how-to-design-programs}.  This text
teaches the fundamentals of programming using a metodology structured
around design principles instead of more conventional approaches that
tend to be structured around the syntactic features in the programming
language being studied.

Although our curriculum development plans with regards to this
proposal are modest, we plan to leverage this experience to reach out
to medical professionals that are interested in programming to teach
them how to program in \poppl{}.

\section{Results from Prior NSF Support}\label{sec:prior-results}

\paragraph{Joint}

Flatt (University of Utah) and Findler have received one join NSF
research grant (CCR-03-06270: \textit{Collaborative: Exploiting Component Contracts for Static Analysis and Testing}, 2003--2005, \$270,947)

Along with their PLT colleagues, they wrote two invited papers in
Dr.~Dobb's Journal. These two papers discuss how to create little
languages with Racket's macro system and how to (almost)
automatically extend DrRacket, the programming environment, so that it
can cope with these embedded little languages. The projects have also
helped support development of Racket.

\paragraph{Findler}

Findler is a Co-PI on one current grant (CCF 1116610 \textit{SHF:
  Small: Integrating Compiler and Architecture Design to Boost Timing
  Speculation}, 9/2011--9/2014, \$493,399).  Results so far include
showing how a compiler can generate code that is more likely to have
good timing characteristics.

Findler shares a collaborative grant (CCF 1064474 \textit{SHF: Medium:
  Collaborative Research: Semantics Engineering for Scripting
  Languages}, 7/2011--7/2014, \$249,988). Results so far include a
new semantics for evaluation contexts.

Findler has also received a one award on his own (CCF 0846012:
\textit{CAREER: Lightweight, Blame-aware Contract Checking},
2009--2014 \$429,723). Results so far include theoretical models of
contracts that support parametric polymorphism and make proper blame
assignment precise, as well as showing how to exploit contracts to
effectively randomly test of higher-order, stateful programs.

All told, Findler's projects have produced more than 30 papers
in conferences and journals.\footnote{See
  \url{http://www.eecs.northwestern.edu/~robby/pubs/} for a complete
  list of publications, all of which were produced thanks to funding
  from NSF grants.}

\paragraph{Flatt}

\textit{An Extensible Gradual Type System via Compile-Time
 Meta-Programming} (CCF-0914759), 07/15/09--06/30/12, \$418,565. This
ongoing project aims to leverage macro-extension techniques for
implementing type systems. By implementing the type system
through macros, the type system itself should become extensible and
interoperate with untyped code, leading to the possibility of gradual
typing (i.e., starting with an untyped module and converting only part
of the module to typed code).

Results so far include an approach to implementing C++ classes via
Scheme-style macros in C~\citep{Atkinson-ABI,Atkinson-SW}, further
work on Typed Racket~\citep{St-Amour-numeric,Tobin-Hochstadt-langs},
and a strategy for merging infix syntax with Scheme-style macros

\textit{Language Towers as Design Frameworks} (CCF-0438847),
01/01/05--12/31/07, \$180,000, a collaborative project with Olin
Shivers and Pete Manolios. This project investigated techniques for
preserving static semantics, such as types, as programs are translated
though layers of macro expansion and compilation.

Specific results from the Utah portion of the project include showing
how language designers can support components by building on existing
component implementations, which still including domain-specific,
compile-time information in component interfaces. Also, our work on
language interoperability demonstrates a technique for integrating
different kinds of languages within a single application, so that
different languages can be used for different parts of the application
without violating compile-time assumptions made in each part. The
latter of these pieces, especially, serves a building block for the
current proposal.

The project contributed to two
dissertations~\citep{Gray-thesis,Owens-thesis}, two conference
publications~\citep{MacroUnits,OwensUnits}, and one workshop
publication~\citep{JavatoScheme}. The Java-related work from this
project has been instrumental in our ongoing outreach effort for
training teachers of introductory computing.

\ourtitle{: Data Management Plan}


We will be capturing data on how patients respond to their treatment
as discussed in the proposal. We will not be using existing data.
Some data that we will collect will be real patient data. 

In particular, we plan to collect data from real patients, including
their diet, physical activity, glucometer readings, and (if necessary)
insulin use. We expect this data to be available in significant
quantities as we expect there to be 300 women with GDM to be seen in
the Maternal-Fetal Medicine Clinic at Northwestern Prentice over the 2
year enrollment period for this proposal. We plan to use this data to
perform pure computer-based simulations that will help us determine
how our POP-GDM program will respond to real-world data.

All real patient data will be de-identified. All real patient data for
this project will be existing patient data.  Some data that we will
collect will be generated during the clinical simulations that will be
used to test the POP-PL software.

We have not decided on the precise format yet for the data and
metadata. Every effort will be made to adhere to the relevant
standards.

This data will be captured from the Northwestern University Enterprise
Data Warehouse (NUEDW). We have extensive experience retrieving data
from the NUEDW.

We will not charge for the data. The data will be available on via the
NEUDW.

There will be no restrictions placed on re-distribution of the data.
We hope that the data will be interesting to the same groups that find
the research itself interesting.

Tidbits:


From building and evaluating POP–GDM, we expect to gain insight useful
for building the Patient–oriented Prescription Programming language
(POP–PL) and Patient–Oriented Prescription Software Engine
(POP-SE). Most physicians and other prescribers have no formal
training in computer programming but do have extensive experience
writing prescriptions. Prescribing is effectively a parallel
discipline using constructs common to software programming but without
the benefit of the elegant conceptual framework provided by computer
science. Thus, our task is not to create a language de novo but to
discover a language prescribers already use and create a
formally–defined version of this language that is intuitive and
robust. This will move us closer to our long term goal of building a
platform that clinicians will use to build their own patient–oriented
prescriptions, narrowing the gap between intent of a prescriber and
performance of their e-prescription.


============================================================

The defeat of human chess champion Gary Kasparov by IBM's Big Blue
computer caused dismay among some people. The significance of
Kasparov's work with ``Advanced Chess'' since then has perhaps been
overlooked. Kasparov has noted that human-computer chess teams can
outperform both humans \emph{and} computers. We draw inspiration from
\citet{kasparov}'s view of how the chess playing human and the chess
playing machine can be greater than the sum of the parts. He writes:
\begin{quote}
\it Having a computer partner also meant never having to worry about
making a tactical blunder. The computer could project the consequences
of each move we considered, pointing out possible outcomes and
countermoves we might otherwise have missed. With that taken care of
 for us, we could concentrate on strategic planning instead of spending
 so much time on calculations. 
\end{quote}
The same is true for medicine. Current practitioners in hospitals
are overwhelmed with routine, mind-numbing and yet crucially important
tasks. Properly exploiting the synergies between people and computers
can make treatment for people far more effective with the same amount
of resources.

Rewritten:

To some, the prospect of machines performing prescription tasks may
raise fears of technology run amok. In rebuttal, consider chess
champion Gary Kasparov’s observation, after his defeat by IBM’s Big
Blue Computer, that a human-computer chess team often outperforms
either a human alone or a computer alone:

Having a computer partner also meant never having to worry about
making a tactical blunder. The computer could project the consequences
of each move we considered, pointing out possible outcomes and
countermoves we might otherwise have missed. With that taken care of
for us, we could concentrate on strategic planning instead of spending
so much time on calculations. [Kasparov 2010]

We expect the same will be true of medicine. Clinicians & patients are
overwhelmed with routine, yet crucial tasks; some tasks are delayed or
omitted. A data barrage consumes the clinician’s attention; detection
of some critical events is delayed or missed. Machines and algorithms
can help. We expect that exploiting synergies between people and
computers will provide patients with more effective, safer, and less
expensive healthcare.


% Stop us if you're heard this one before: In domain \emph{X}, too much
% of an \emph{X}er's time is spent on repetitive administrative tasks.
% Computers could automatically and reliably perform the tasks but there are no off-the-shelf
% solutions available. To unleash the full power of computing in domain \emph{X},
% we need to develop tools that empower \emph{X}ers to become
% programmers rather than mere users. Technology \emph{Y} can make this
% happen. We plan to validate our work by tackling specific problem \emph{Z}.
 
% While the basic story line of our proposal is familiar, the work we propose here is unique in the opportunity
% it provides to explore the frontiers of computer science and in the potential it has to improve 
% the lives of millions of people. In our case, \emph{X} is medicine and \emph{X}ers are medical
% professionals, \emph{Y} is the Racket virtual machine and toolkit for domain-specific languages,
% and \emph{Z} is the prevention and treatment of GDM. A particular
% strength of our proposal is that we build on a firmly established foundation:
% \vspace*{-.1in}
% \begin{itemize}\setlength{\itemsep}{2pt}  \setlength{\parskip}{0pt}  \setlength{\parsep}{0pt}
% \item We are not guessing or generalizing about the kinds of tasks
%  where computational thinking has already been demonstrated to be
%   salient, substantive, and feasible.  Our team's work has
%   demonstrated specifically how thinking of prescriptions as
%   programs---even when they are simply implemented on paper---can make
%   the practice of medicine dramatically safer~\citep{Belknap2008}.
% 
% \item Our interdisciplinary team includes experts in
%   endocrinology and maternal-fetal medicine who are
%   internationally-acknowledged leaders in the domain of the prevention
%   and management of GDM.
% 
% \item Our target application for managing GDM is specific and
%  relevant. GDM is a precisely defined entity. GDM affects hundreds of thousands of patients in the US. The
%  need for prevention and treatment of GDM is expected to grow rapidly.
%  
% \item A large group of potential users awaits. The recent proliferation of smart-phones, glucometers, accelerometers,
% and other portable devices provides a large number of patients, nurses, physicians, and pharmacists who are familiar with
% the user interface and hardware to be used for this project. CPOE systems have been installed in roughly
% 20\% of medical centers and adoption of CPOE continues at a rapid pace.
% 
% \item Our software is mature. Our  team's toolset for domain-specific languages is widely
%  deployed. We have previously used this software to solve important, real–world problems. Significanti research remains
%  in finding the right computatonal model for prescriptions as programs, but our initial analysis suggests an
%  event-driven programming model would mesh well with current
%  computing and networking infrastructure (e.g., HTTP).
% 
% \end{itemize}
% \vspace*{-.1in}

% In the future, e-prescriptions will be error-resistant, 
% effective, and evidence-based. We intend to build and test software that
% will make this possible. A prescription is ``a health-care program
% implemented by a physician or other medical practitioner in the form of
% instructions that govern the plan of care for an individual 
% patient.''~\citep{Belknap2008}
% The apparent simplicity of prescriptions is deceptive.
% The prescriber's terse verbal, handwritten, or typed instructions invoke
% subroutines: patient instructions, nursing and pharmacy practices,
% standard operating procedures, lab methods, and operating instructions. We
% first identified that a prescription is a program---a medical algorithm and
% showed that “algorithmic medicine” improves outcomes, reduces
% time-burden, and lowers cost of a paper prescription. \emph{This proposed work,
% where we adapt these methods to e-prescriptions is significant because
% it provides a conceptual framework for performance improvement of
% virtually every medical intervention that requires following
% instructions.} We propose to apply this novel "algorithmic medicine" concept to
% the prevention and treatment of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM).
